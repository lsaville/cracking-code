I'm a software developer with experience on the front and back end, who is
eager to keep learning and finding new/better solutions to problems.

Coming from a background in the service industry and construction I bring a
unique perspective to everything I do. 

Developer with experience developing full stack Rails, I spend time on both
the front and the back ends. I'm enthusiatic and eager to continue learning and
tackling new and varied challenges while bringing my unique service industry and
construction background to the table.

Developer who enjoys applying larger context into smaller scale problems, I'm
always searching for a new or better way to acheive and end. My philosophical
bent and costumer service background help me approach problems from a slightly
different angle. I'm eager to continue learning by joining an enthusiatic team
where we'll tackle business challenges together.

Developer with his head so far up his ass, daylight can be seen through the
orifice of the mouth. I'll thrill and delight you with my propensities for fast
learning and providing the absolute optimal solution to any given problem. Let's
join forces to take over the world.

With a background in the service industry and light construction, I found
software development to be a meaningful application of my active mind. I'm eager
to join your team to forge new paths into the digital wilderness while learning
and providing business value. I've got experience typing words at a keyboard,
you're sure to want me!!!

Hard working with a background in the service industry, customer service comes
as second nature to my seasoned digital hand. I'd Love to supercharge a team and
contribute in a bountiful way to your making bonkers amounts of money.

sincerelee yours
